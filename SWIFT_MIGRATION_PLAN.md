# Sleepster Swift/SwiftUI Migration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a systematic approach to modernize Sleepster from Objective-C/UIKit to Swift/SwiftUI while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the codebase architecture.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Project Configuration
- **Update minimum iOS version** to iOS 15+ (required for modern SwiftUI features)
- **Create new Swift project structure** alongside existing Objective-C code
- **Update CocoaPods** to support Swift dependencies
- **Replace AFNetworking 1.3** with modern URLSession or Alamofire 5.x
- **Configure bridging headers** for gradual migration

### 1.2 Core Data Migration
- **Convert Core Data model** to Swift
- **Create Swift Core Data stack** using `NSPersistentContainer`
- **Port DatabaseManager** to Swift as singleton with modern async/await patterns
- **Convert Sound and Background entities** to Swift classes with Codable support

## Phase 2: Core Architecture (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 App Structure
- **Create SwiftUI App** entry point replacing `iSleepAppDelegate`
- **Implement TabView** replacing `UITabBarController`
- **Create ViewModels** for each major screen using ObservableObject
- **Implement dependency injection** container for shared services

### 2.2 State Management
- **Create AppState** observable object for global state
- **Implement AudioManager** for sound playbook with AVAudioEngine
- **Create TimerManager** for sleep timer functionality
- **Port settings management** to UserDefaults with @AppStorage

## Phase 3: View Controllers → SwiftUI Views (Week 5-8)

### 3.1 Main Sleep Interface
- **Port MainViewController** → `SleepView` with timer controls
- **Implement sleep timer** with SwiftUI animations
- **Add volume controls** using SwiftUI sliders
- **Create audio visualizer** with Canvas or custom views

### 3.2 Feature Views
- **SoundsViewController** → `SoundsListView` with grid layout
- **BackgroundsViewController** → `BackgroundsView` with async image loading
- **TimerViewController** → `TimerSettingsView` with picker controls
- **SettingsViewController** → `SettingsView` with form layouts
- **InformationViewController** → `AboutView` with links and info

### 3.3 Supporting Views
- **BacklightViewController** → `BrightnessControlView`
- **Create custom SwiftUI components** for reusable UI elements
- **Implement navigation** with NavigationStack

## Phase 4: Services & Networking (Week 9-10)

### 4.1 Networking Layer
- **Replace FlickrAPIClient** with modern async/await URLSession
- **Implement proper error handling** with Result types
- **Add image caching** with NSCache or third-party solution
- **Create network monitoring** for offline capabilities

### 4.2 Audio System
- **Port AVAudioPlayer+PGFade** to Swift extension
- **Implement audio session management** with proper interruption handling
- **Add audio mixing capabilities** for multiple sounds
- **Create audio presets** and equalizer features

## Phase 5: In-App Purchases & Advanced Features (Week 11-12)

### 5.1 IAP System
- **Port SleepsterIAPHelper** to Swift with StoreKit 2
- **Implement subscription management** if needed
- **Add purchase restoration** and validation
- **Create paywall UI** in SwiftUI

### 5.2 Advanced Features
- **Add sleep tracking** with HealthKit integration
- **Implement widget support** with WidgetKit
- **Add Shortcuts app** integration
- **Create watch app** companion (optional)

## Phase 6: Polish & Testing (Week 13-14)

### 6.1 UI/UX Improvements
- **Implement Dark Mode** support
- **Add accessibility** features
- **Create custom animations** and transitions
- **Optimize for different screen sizes**

### 6.2 Testing & Deployment
- **Create comprehensive test suite** with XCTest
- **Add UI tests** with SwiftUI testing
- **Performance optimization** and memory leak detection
- **Update fastlane** configuration for Swift project

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM** with SwiftUI and ObservableObject
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Coordinator pattern** for navigation (if needed)
- **Dependency injection** for testability

### Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **Combine** for reactive programming
- **async/await** for asynchronous operations
- **Core Data** with CloudKit sync (optional)
- **AVAudioEngine** for advanced audio features

### Migration Strategy
1. **Hybrid approach**: Run Swift and Objective-C side-by-side
2. **Feature-by-feature** migration to minimize risk
3. **Maintain existing API** contracts during transition
4. **Extensive testing** at each phase
5. **Gradual removal** of Objective-C code after validation

### Potential Challenges
- **Core Data migration** complexity
- **Audio playback** continuity during transition
- **Legacy XIB files** conversion to SwiftUI
- **Third-party dependencies** compatibility
- **App Store submission** with mixed codebase

### Success Metrics
- **Feature parity** with existing app
- **Performance improvements** (faster launch, smoother animations)
- **Code quality** (reduced complexity, better testability)
- **Maintainability** (modern Swift patterns, clear architecture)

This migration will result in a modern, maintainable iOS app that leverages the latest Swift and SwiftUI capabilities while preserving all existing functionality that users expect from Sleepster.
