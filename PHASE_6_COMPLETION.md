## Technical Implementation Details

### Testing Architecture

```swift
// Example test structure
@MainActor
final class StoreKitManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    var storeKitManager: StoreKitManager!
    
    func testLoadProducts() async throws {
        await storeKitManager.loadProducts()
        XCTAssertFalse(storeKitManager.isLoading)
    }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```swift
class PerformanceMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published var memoryUsage: Double = 0.0
    @Published var cpuUsage: Double = 0.0
    @Published var audioLatency: Double = 0.0
    
    private func getCurrentMemoryUsage() -> Double {
        // Real-time memory tracking implementation
    }
}
```

### Memory Optimization

```swift
class MemoryOptimizer {
    private var imageCache: NSCache<NSString, UIImage>
    
    func handleMemoryWarning() {
        imageCache.removeAllObjects()
        ImageCache.shared.clearCache()
        // Force resource cleanup
    }
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks
