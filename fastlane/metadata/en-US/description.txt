Sleepster is a simple to use sleep assistant that provides a nature background/nightlight in combination with soothing background music and a sound timer. Choose the sound, sound timer, and nightlight background settings and then select the play button. The sliders adjust the volume of the background music and screen brightness. The sound will stop playing at the selected time interval. Tapping the nightlight screen will immediately stop the music and return you to the main screen where you can readjust settings if desired. Sleepster can also be used to assist in meditation, yoga, stress relief or anytime a soothing atmosphere is desired.
